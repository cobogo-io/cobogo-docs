# Support our Project

> "Dev Protocol is on-chain middleware created for a whole new ecosystem designed for Open Source Software (OSS). With Dev Protocol, anyone can start to monetize their creations without changing licenses, codes, and support."

Dev Protocol allows the monetization of OSS projects through its inflationary DEV Tokens. This means that every year, 3.15% new DEVs are minted and allocated to Creators and Stakers, in a 51:49 split.

When you buy DEV tokens, you can choose a project to stake on and receive a yield in the form of inflationary rewards. In other words, both you and the Project Creator get interest, allowing you to sustainably fund your favorite OSS projects.

There are currently over 1,600 OSS projects onboarded, and over $600,000 staked in DEV tokens.

You can sustainably fund our project development and growth using Dev Protocol's staking mechanism and their dapp [stakes.social](https://stakes.social), where both you and Cobogo get rewards.

Here's a [guide](https://docs.devprotocol.xyz/en/stakes-social/how-to-buy/) on how to buy DEV tokens and [how to stake](https://docs.devprotocol.xyz/en/stakes-social/how-to-stake/) on a project.
