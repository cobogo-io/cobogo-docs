## What is Coinvise and how it helps cobogo

As written in Coinvise's own [docs](https://coinvise.notion.site/About-5fb7ccf93bbe4257bde71a5be73537be) :

> Coinvise is an open platform on Ethereum where creators can launch a social & build a tokenized community.

With Coinvise, Creators and Communites can create social tokens, airdrop them, create rewards and bounties. We see the airdrop, rewards and bounties mechanisms useful not only for cobogo but for all the Content Creators that mint their social tokens through cobogo. This way we want to set the precedent and be involved with other important Creator Economy and Social Tokens platforms.

For cobogo, we see the Quest system being really important for our goals. The CBG tokens will start off as Social Tokens and we want to involve the community as much as possible in building the platform.&#x20;
