# Dev Protocol

## What it is

[Dev Protocol](https://docs.devprotocol.xyz/en/introduction/) is a Japanese project that allows Creators to monetize their work in a sustainable way.&#x20;

They do this currently in their [stakes.social](https://stakes.social) dApp, where Open Source Software (OSS) Creators can apply their projects through the onboarding process, get their project authenticated, have their Social Tokens minted, and finally have their Staking Pool deployed, where Patrons can stake DEV Tokens on, similarly to Cobogo.

With Dev Protocol many more markets can arise, empowering communities and capturing the value of the Creator Economy.

## How it works

This is all possible due to the token being inflationary, which means that every year 3.15% new DEV tokens are minted and allocated to Creators and Stakers, in a 51:49 split.

By staking, both Creators and Patrons receive a yield in the form of inflationary rewards. Stakers can also hold governance rights over Dev Protocol, and for that, can have a voice in deciding tokenomics or proposing new ideas.&#x20;
