# Drips Network

**Potential integration is still being deliberated**

We have envisioned a reward distributing design that leverages Drips Network to fund Content Creators in the cobogo ecosystem directly by their own community members and indirectly - funding the top 10 creators - by funding cobogo itself. The proposed system could work like this:

As soon as we have the idea more clear we'll update the page.

**Drips quickly explained**

cobogo found that the Drips system is a great fit for our vision of community building and alternative ways of funding Creators. Here is how it is described in their docs:

1 - A creator or developer chooses a funding goal and minimum supporter contribution and then creates a Community using the Drips web app at drips.radicle.network. Behind the scenes, the new Community is deployed to the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-721 contract, which is 100% owned and controlled by the creator.

2 - Next, the creator must decide on the benefits (if any) they wish to offer to users who purchase memberships. Examples of benefits include access to gated Discord channels or the ability to participate in governance polls using Snapshot.

3 - Supporters who wish to purchase memberships and "Drip" to the creator can do so by navigating to the page for the new Community in the Drips web app and clicking "Fund". They will then be prompted to choose an amount of DAI they would like to donate and also an amount of DAI that they would like to set aside in advance to use for payment. An NFT membership badge is minted and sent to their Ethereum address. The NFT serves as both a badge of support and also a key that unlocks access to the benefits offered.

4 - Finally, the creator can choose to "spread the love" by specifying percentages of incoming funds that will be shared and dripped onwards to other users. Recipients of these drip "shares" could be contributors, charities, or other projects that they Community depends upon (e.g. a software library or other dependency).
