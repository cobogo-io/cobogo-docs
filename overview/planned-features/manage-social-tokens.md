## Coinvise&#x20;

As written in Coinvise's own [docs](https://coinvise.notion.site/About-5fb7ccf93bbe4257bde71a5be73537be) :

> Coinvise is an open platform on Ethereum where creators can launch a social & build a tokenized community.

With Coinvise, Creators and Communities can mint social tokens, airdrops them,  create rewards and bounties. We see all of the airdrop, rewards and bounties mechanisms useful not only for cobogo but for all the Content Creators that mint their social tokens through cobogo. This way, we want to set the precedent and be involved with other important Creator Economy and Social Tokens platforms.
