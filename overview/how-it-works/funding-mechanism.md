# Funding Mechanism

We have designed an **unique funding mechanism** that allows fans to support their favorite Content Creators **sustainably**.

Based on DeFi, our platform works by having the Content Creator **mint their own Staking Pool**, where their fans and community can stake CBG tokens in. After that, **both Creators and Fans get rewarded** in the form of a yield, in a 50%/50% split.

In sum, fans will be able to buy CBG tokens, stake those tokens in their favorite Content Creator's pool, and then earn the rewards on a block (minute) basis, based on the current APY (Annual Percentage Yield).

These tokens **will not be locked** for any period of time, which means the fan will be able to withdraw them anytime they want, as well as the rewards accrued.

This way, **Content Creators can monetize their work without having to rely on a single point of failure**, and Fans can support Creators while still keeping their principal, and earning interest on top of it.
