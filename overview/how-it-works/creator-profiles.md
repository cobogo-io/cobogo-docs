# Creator Profiles

Most Content Creators have gone through the trouble of having to organize a **Media Kit**. A Media Kit is like a **digital resume**, that displays someone's information, work, metrics, audience demographics, and collaboration options, and for that, they are an **essential tool** to any Creator looking to collaborate with brands.&#x20;

Media Kits also serve as way to **raise awareness** of a Creator's personal brand, so they're useful even for beginners.

Cobogo will facilitate the work of Creators by having **all the needed information for a Media Kit in just one place**, where they can **showcase their services to high-quality clients**, in standardized **Creator Profiles**.

This will also simplify brands' work, since **cobogo will match the world's best Content Creators** enlisted in our platform to project proposals, without the exorbitant prices that agencies charge.

The way it works is by having the Profiles generated automatically when Creators join the platform, which they will be able to edit once they authenticate it. Then, cobogo will help clients find the Creators **that best fit their needs**. In the future, this entire process will be run by the **cobogo DAO**.
