# Creator Profiles

Most Content Creators have gone through the trouble of having to organize a **Media Kit**. A Media Kit is like a **digital resume**, that displays someone's information, work, metrics, audience demographics, and collaboration options, and for that, they are an **essential tool** to any Creator looking to collaborate with brands.

Media Kits also serve as way to **raise awareness** of a Creator's personal brand, so they're useful even for beginners.

### Cobogo's Solution

Cobogo will facilitate the work of Creators by having **all the needed information for a Media Kit in just one place**, where they can **showcase their services to high-quality clients**, in standardized **Creator Profiles**.

This will also simplify brands' work, since **cobogo will match the world's best Content Creators** enlisted in our platform to project proposals, without the exorbitant prices that agencies charge. This will be called the Media Market.

### Creating the profiles

There are two ways that creator profiles can be generated. First, by **completing the whitelisting process** and connecting a YouTube account, a profile is **automatically  generated** and authenticated with all the public information available.&#x20;

The Creator can edit and add information to **increase the probability of being hired** by third parties and attracting stakers in the future.&#x20;

Another way is through the **premade profiles** that cobogo will generate strategically and by demand. In this case, profiles won't be authenticated and the creator that wishes to edit and add information will have to claim it, by going through the whitelisting process (connecting a YouTube channel).&#x20;

### Media Market

At first, the cobogo team will **curate Creators** to fit a market demand from clients that need a product marketing strategy.&#x20;

Clients will also be able to freely select the **Creators that best fit their brandâ€™s needs**, and create a bundle of creators so they can put their desired marketing plan in motion.&#x20;

In the future, **the DAO will be taking control** over the decisions and negotiations made in the Media Market.

The main benefit of this market is that Creators that form the cobogo DAO **will be their own media agency** through cobogo, and all the media value generated by the collective of Creators that compose cobogo will be collected by the DAO (which is owned by the Creators themselves).

There will be a 5% fee on third parties for all the media that they hire with cobogo as an agency, and the fees will go to the **DAO Treasury**.
