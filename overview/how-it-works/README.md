With [cobogo](https://cobogo.social/), **Creators don't need to rely solely in Big Tech platforms for their funding**; instead they can be funded directly by their own communities using our **split reward monetization mechanism** where both Fans and Creators get rewarded. They can also expand their possibilities for monetization by collaborating with brands, directly through cobogo.

It works as follows:

1. Creators submit their channel and get their Profiles authenticated;
2. After that, Creators can deploy a Staking Pool and edit their Profiles;
3. Creators can be matched with clients for collaboration;
4. With the Staking Pool in place, Fans can deposit CBG tokens and stake on it;
5. Both Creator and Fan start getting the rewards accrued.

Creators will also be able to offer **special perks** to those Fans who stake on them, such as the Creator's Social Tokens, access to a private discord, special content and many more.

In addition, cobogo makes it possible for small and niche Creators to **monetize their work by their own community**, without having to wait for the 1,000 subscribers count, or being "ad friendly".

Cobogo is building an ecosystem for Creators of all kinds. Everything will be possible through the cobogo DAO, and the following features:

* [Creator Profiles](creator-profiles/)
* [Split Yield Mechanism](broken-reference)
* [Cobogo Fan Token](broken-reference)
* [Content Creator NFT](broken-reference)
