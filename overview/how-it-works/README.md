# How it works?

With [cobogo](https://cobogo.social/), Creators don't need to rely solely in Big Tech platforms for their funding; instead they can be funded directly by their own communities using our split reward funding mechanism where both Fans and Creators get rewarded.&#x20;

It works as follows:

1. Creators submit their channel to be reviewed;
2. Once approved, the Creators can deploy a Staking Pool;
3. With the Staking Pool in place, Patrons can deposit CBG tokens and stake on it;
4. Both Creator and Patron start getting the rewards accrued.

Creators will also be able to offer special perks to those Patrons who stake on them, such as the Creator's Social Tokens, access to a private discord, special content and many more.

In addition, cobogo makes it possible for small and niche YouTube Creators to monetize their work by their own community, without having to wait for the 1,000 subscribers count, or being "ad friendly".&#x20;
