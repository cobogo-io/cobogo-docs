### How it works

Creators who want to professionalize themselves and become real businesses can find the best environment to do that on Cobogo Basecamp. Our education and acceleration programs will be divided by tiers (to be announced) where Creators will learn how to incorporate and run a business, raise capital and use cutting edge tools to launch their own public offering. They'll have access to other Creators who are going through the same process, sharing tips and encouraging each other.

The first step to transform Creators into a real business. We provide the easiest way to incorporate businesses in the jurisdictions that our technology partners operate. It's as easy as submitting a short application with future business details and going through the incoporation process online.

Creators, with our future technology partners, can launch their own public offerings raising funds continuously and sharing their success with their investors. They can define the terms of fundraising like company valuation, allocation, initial price, minimum investment, etc. The technologies we will provide are already being used by investors and are legally compliant, have been reviewed by top lawyers.
