# Cobogo Basecamp

### Summary

Cobogo Fundraise transforms the creator's business (see [Cobogo Start](broken-reference)) into a Continuous Organization - which “aligns stakeholders’ interests in their financial success”. Creators can tokenize equity as a SEC-compliant security and apply Rolling SAFE for Continuous Securities Offering with which they can raise funds, and share their success with their own audience.

More info [here](https://github.com/C-ORG/whitepape) and [here](https://github.com/C-ORG/whitepape).

### How it works

Creators create their SEC-compliant security token that represents the equity of their company and define the terms of fundraising like company valuation, allocation, initial price, minimum investment, etc.

The platform provides all legal documentation to be used with investors and government reviewed by top lawyers.

The Cobogo Social's profile is enriched with a widget that allows anyone to invest in the company anytime. This is the benefit of the Continuous Security Offering.

Cobogo Labs captures value from all successful creators using Cobogo Fundraise, by capturing 1% of creator businesses' equity. The $CBGE (Cobogo Labs equity token) can be seen as a Creator Economy ETF.

### Value Proposition

Creators as businesses can access Continuous Fundraising with their own community. Any fan from your audience can invest in your business for equity any time, from the launch to the IPO.
