# Cobogo Fan Token

CFT is an NFT (ERC-1155 token) introduced at the cobogo ecosystem as a mechanism to introduce perks that Creators can provide for their fan base.

This NFT can only be minted by individuals that stake CBG tokens at a Creator  Staking Pool. It represents a staking position and is minted as follows:

At the moment a Fan stakes their tokens in a Creator Staking Pool, an NFT is minted and transferred to them.&#x20;

This NFT contains all the metadata regarding that staking position, including how many tokens were deposited, blocktime, and which smart contract (specific to a singular Creator).

This NFT can be used as keys to access perks, such as [gated videos](../planned-features/gated-content.md#why-is-cobogo-the-best-fit-for-this-solution) or communities, and it is a proof of active funding - holders of this NFT are continuously funding their favorite creator.

The main benefit of introducing the CFT is that it can be traded on a secondary market as well. Individuals could sell their staking position directly to other fans, including the rewards.
