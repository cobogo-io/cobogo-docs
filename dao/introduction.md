# Introduction

cobogoDAO is a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) that aims to support content creators and develop the creator economy. It is an open platform for proposals that are voted upon by [CBG](../token/cbg/) token holders.

Possible proposals include:

* partnerships
* cobogo social development
* project investments
* tokenomics changes

### Vision

Our vision is a world of content creation backed by web3 and by autonomous investors instead of big centralized platforms.

### Mission

To support content creators allowing them to finance their work independently of big platforms.

To develop the creator economy by investing and creating tools that allow anyone to use the benefits of web3 to support and grow their community.

### Principles

* cobogoDAO is not a company. It does not have a management team or employees. It is a [foundation](the-foundation.md) whose members are the CBG token holders.
* cobogoDAO is [governed](governance.md) by its members. Any member can propose partnerships, investments, or product development. Members will vote on whether to approve or reject these proposals.
* cobogoDAO will rely on a [service provider](service-provider.md) to facilitate various administrative functions.
