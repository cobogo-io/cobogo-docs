# Service Provider

cobogoDAO is member-managed and does not have any general partner. cobogoDAO will rely on a service provider to facilitate various administrative functions on behalf of the members, including:

* preparing and sending annual financial reports;
* validating information related to partnerships;
* due diligence of projects selected for investments;
* executing the proposals approved by members;
* administration of tools.

From the legal perspective, the service provider is the company nominated as the director of the foundation.
