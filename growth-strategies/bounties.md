# Bounties

As a way to distribute CBG tokens to the community, cobogo will have Referral Programs, in the form of bounties. These bounties will happen in three phases, and in each, different amounts of CBGs will be up for grabs. In total, 8,000,000 CBGs will be handed out, as a way to encourage the community’s growth.

### Phase 1

In the first phase, an already enlisted Creator will be able to get 50 CBG in commission for each Creator he invites that starts using the platform, while the invited Creator will get 100 CBG. This means that the more friends someone invites, the more CBG tokens they earn. A total of 2,500,000 CBG will be destined for commissions for both inviters and invitees. It is worth noting that in order to earn the CBG, it is necessary for the invited Creator to mint their pool on the dApp.

### Phase 2

In the second phase the invitee will earn 50 CBG, while the Creator will earn 25 CBG to each referred Creator that mints their pool using the Creator’s unique referral link. The amount of 1,500,000 CBG will be distributed, equivalent to 1.5% of the total of CBG tokens.

### Phase 3

In the third phase, 1,000,000 more CBG will be assigned, corresponding to 1.0% of the total of CBG tokens. In this phase we will continue our efforts to grow our community, specially the number of Content Creators to be staked on. However, the referred Content Creator friend will only get 25 CBG, while the one who invites them will earn 10 CBG for each enrolled Creator. It must be pointed out that every token earned in all of these three phases will be locked for a year before being able to be traded on DEXs.
