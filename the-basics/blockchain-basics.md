### 1. What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a technology that features a continuous list of blocks of information on a live network of computers. Each block contains a number of transactions that when filled, are closed and linked to the previously filled block, with other computers checking them using special algorithms.&#x20;

The most important aspect about Blockchain is that they are decentralized, which means that no computer or agent can modify the log of events stored in the chain. That is, it doesn't rely on a single authority, but on a diverse group of smaller players.

All of that ensures Blockchain's security and makes it the most suitable technology for financial applications

### 2. What are cryptocurrencies?

Cryptocurrencies are digital assets that operate on decentralized blockchain networks. Like other currencies, they can be used as means to buy services and goods on the internet, but with the advantage of security, privacy, speed and low cost.&#x20;

There are thousands of different cryptocurrencies on the market, and people can invest on them as any other asset. However, doing that can be risky, so it is recommended to do some fair amount of research to fully understand how each system works.

### 3. What is a Decentralized Market?

Saying something is a Decentralized Market means that the technology allows the people in it to trade directly with each other instead of relying on a centralized authority like a bank, or any other type of middlemen. People only need to be connected to a _node_ that will transfer the data needed, and don't have to know or trust the people they are trading with.

A Decentralized Market is a good example of peer-to-peer network.

### 4. What is a Centralized Market?

In Centralized Markets, all orders are led by a central exchange point without an authority or competitive validator. This means that every buy order goes to the exchange, where they are matched with a sell order.

Centralized marketplaces often have higher fees, lack transparency, while also having greater security risks because the network relies on a single point which increases the chances of failure or hacking.

### 5. What is Ethereum?

Ethereum is a network of cryptocurrencies launched in 2015, that has been adopted by numerous projects from all over the world.

The most distinctive features of the Ethereum network is its “Proof of Stake” (PoS) consensus algorithm and its ability to host “smart contracts”. It is also the largest network that hosts dapps, and it is where most developer activity happens in the crypto space.

### 6. What are Smart Contracts?

Smart Contracts are basically self-executable programs that run once predetermined conditions are met, used to automate the execution of an agreement so that all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome, without any intermediary’s involvement or time loss.

For that, they are not directly controlled by a user and are published to run independently of the network and those who program it, making them more reliable. They are also open to scrutiny by anyone who wants to access the public network, which aligns with the transparent nature of Blockchain.

In addition, individuals can interact with the smart contract by submitting transactions that will trigger some events in the contract.&#x20;

### 7. What is Gas?

Gas is the fee required to do the amount of computational work to validate a transaction in the network. This work is done by the nodes that dedicate their computational power to maintain the network, and in return, are paid a feed for all transactions.&#x20;

This fee is calculated in terms of ETH.&#x20;
