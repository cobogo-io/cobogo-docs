# Week 22 - 03/06/2022

### Medium

We have posted perhaps the most import article for cobogo so far. This new piece explains thoroughly what cobogo is, what it brings to the Creator Economy, and how it is extremely well positioned for the future of Web3.

In this article we describe cobogo's two major features, and some features we plan for the future.&#x20;

You can check it out [here](https://medium.com/@cobogosocial/discover-cobogo-web3-creator-monetization-965ff70732b8).&#x20;

### Design

We have been multitasking this week and on a few things. We're working on a new design for the website (and it's looking really good) and on a new pitch deck.

As mentioned last week, we're also working on the Creator Profiles, that you can check on last week's [Weekly Updates](week-21-27-05-2022.md), and this week we have continued to work on that.

We are also working with a Brazilian design studio to create an animation that explains in a fun way what cobogo is, and it's almost ready! We can't wait to share it with everyone.

Take a look at a sneak peek of the new website:&#x20;

And take a look at this feature for the Creator Profile! Creators will be able to showcase what services they offer to clients:

### Development

This week we have continued the hard work, and we have focused mainly on implementing the Creator Profiles, so we can have it deployed as soon as possible.

You can check our [GitHub](https://github.com/cobogo-social) to see more details of what we've been doing.

### Growth

We have thought of a new way to expand cobogo's Ecosystem, and we will perfect it with time.&#x20;

You can check the initial idea it [here](../../growth-strategies/cobogo-expanse.md).
