# Week 21 - 27/05/2022

### Polygon DAO Grant

At the end of this week we have received some amazing news regarding one of the grants we've applied to. Polygon DAO has announced that we've been awarded with their Starter Pack Voucher Grant, that will help us with consultancy to further develop our project.

The PolygonDAO team has been very responsive and kept us updated since we first applied, so we are really excited to start working with them and their voucher partners.

### Medium

We have posted an article on Medium explaining what Media Kits are and how they fit into cobogo's new scope.

As mentioned in the previous Weekly Updates, we have encountered some difficulties onboarding Creators, and we believe expanding cobogo's scope to be more than a funding mechanism, but a platform that allows Creators to advertise their work to potential clients will be more beneficial.

You can check the article [here](https://medium.com/@cobogosocial/what-is-a-media-kit-and-why-you-should-have-one-no-matter-what-bf57f33d482c), and cobogo's new scope [here](<../../README (1).md>).

### Development

We have been busy implementing the new profile page, that will serve as the Media Kit for Creators.

You can check our [GitHub](https://github.com/cobogo-social) to see more details of what we've been doing.

### Design

Here are some sneak peeks of the new Media Kit/Profile page.
