### Development

We are really close to launching the Creator Profiles. We hope to have it ready and onboarding Creators in this upcoming week.

### Medium

We have posted a new article about Web2 and Web3 ways in which artists can make money to achieve financial freedom or just to supplement income.&#x20;

We want everyone who creates any types of content to be able to use cobogo's tools and thrive from it.
