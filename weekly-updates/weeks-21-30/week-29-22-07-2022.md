### Creator Profiles

The Creator Profiles have finally been launched! Creators of all kinds can now have all the needed information for a Media Kit in just one place, where they can showcase their services to potential clients, in standardized and styled profiles.

This is the first step to cobogo's Media Market, where cobogo will match the world's best Content Creators enlisted in our platform to project proposals, without the exorbitant prices that agencies charge.

This week, most of the design and development work went into launching the Creator Profiles, including fixing bugs and perfecting the details.

We also had a meeting with [Cope Studio](https://cope.studio/), partnered with Polygon, to get feedbacks on the profiles.

### Medium

We have been working on an article about yield-bearing NFTs as proof of Creators' continuous monetization, which is a feature we plan on introducing later in cobogo.

This article will be posted early next week.
