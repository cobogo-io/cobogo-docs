# Week 27 - 08/07/2022

### Tokenomics

As described in the last Weekly Updates, we have worked in the past few weeks in a document with all of our Tokenomics' details. We have included some features that weren't described in this documentation yet, so we have added them as well.

We believe this document will be a great way to show investors what we have been working on, in a sense that we want them to see we know what we're doing, and everything is well thought out.

You can check cobogo's Tokenomics document through [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZU0nbnju3p-UilOdVNTFE1LOA60hl0Tn/view?usp=drivesdk).

Our whole [Tokenomics](broken-reference) section in this documentation has been updated a well.
