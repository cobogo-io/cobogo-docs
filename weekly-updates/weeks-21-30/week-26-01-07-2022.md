# Week 26 - 01/07/2022

### Development

We have been working really hard to have the Creator Profiles feature ready as soon as possible. We have gotten in touch with a few YouTubers that liked the idea, so we want to have them onboard cobogo once the Profiles are ready.

We predict it will go live in two weeks.

We have also fixed some minor issues in the Whitelisting Process.

### Tokenomics

We have been working for the past few days on a Medium article describing our Tokenomics to those who don't want to read it thoroughly in our docs. However, we have decided to turn this article into a document, like a whitepaper, so we can present it to investors.

A shorter version of this document will still be posted on Medium in this coming week.

### Design

Here's a sneak peek of how it will be for Creators to edit their Creator Profiles.
