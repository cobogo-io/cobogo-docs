# Week 25 - 24/06/2022

### Gitcoin

This week the matching round on Gitcoin ended, and we're really happy with how it turned out. We have received donations from 43 contributors!

We are really glad to see our community coming together to help us build!&#x20;

Every single dollar received will be used for developing cobogo.

### Mask Network

Mask Network has posted an article reviewing the best projects, broken down into 7 categories, listed on Gitcoin's Round 14.&#x20;

We were delighted to see that cobogo was included in the list, in the "Creator Economy" category!

### Development and Design

This week our main focus has been the Creator Profiles, and we believe that we are quite advanced in this task.&#x20;

We hope to have the Profiles ready as soon as possible, so Creator who onboard our whitelist can edit it and share it when they want.

Here's a sneak peek:

### NFT NYC

One of our co-founders, Rafael, is in NFT NYC this week! He is there watching seminars, connecting with other projects, investors, participating on side events, and presenting cobogo to the world!

He has gotten into touch with some important projects that are building similar things to us, and for that, we are really excited to what the future holds for cobogo

### Medium

We are still working on the article about our Tokenomics. It is taking longer than expected because we have decided to change the scope and make it a document, similar to a whitepaper, and not just a 2-pager.

We have also posted an article talking about what it means to be verified on Social Media and how it can make Creator's job easier, since we plan on integrating verification to cobogo.
