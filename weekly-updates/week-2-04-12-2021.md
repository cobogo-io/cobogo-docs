# Week 2 - 04/12/2021

We continue on our mission to be transparent and keep our community up to date on everything that is being done.

We have added a new step to the onboarding pages, regarding the network. Here's how the pages are looking so far:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/1-Submit a channel - 00.png>)![](<../.gitbook/assets/2-Submit a channel - 01.png>)![](<../.gitbook/assets/3-Submit a channel - 02.png>)![](<../.gitbook/assets/4-Submit a channel - 03 (1).png>)![](<../.gitbook/assets/5-Submit a channel - 03-2.png>)![](<../.gitbook/assets/6-Submit a channel - 03-3.png>)![](<../.gitbook/assets/7-Submit a channel - 03 - Waitlist.png>)![](<../.gitbook/assets/8-Submit a channel - 04.png>)![](<../.gitbook/assets/09-Submit a channel - 04-2.png>)![](<../.gitbook/assets/10-Submit a channel - 05.png>)![](<../.gitbook/assets/11-Submit a channel - 05-2.png>)![](<../.gitbook/assets/12-Submit a channel - 06.png>)![](<../.gitbook/assets/13-Submit a channel - 8.png>)![](<../.gitbook/assets/14-Submit a channel - 06-3.png>)![](<../.gitbook/assets/15-Submit a channel - 07.png>)

We have also worked on our first [Medium article](https://medium.com/@cobogosocial/what-is-cobogo-7a895bfce3ea), explaining Cobogo's scope, and on publishing this Gitbook with our documentation.

Stay tuned for upcoming updates. For any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out to us on our [Telegram](https://t.me/cobogosocial) group.&#x20;
