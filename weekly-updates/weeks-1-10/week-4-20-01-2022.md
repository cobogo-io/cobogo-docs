# Week 4 - 20/01/2022

### Tokenomics

In the past days, we have continued working on ways to make cobogo competitive while still being beneficial to the community, and mostly active CBG token holders.&#x20;

We have worked on explaining how our platform's fee system will work, which you can check [here](../../token/cbg/platform-fee.md).

In addition, we have been discussing our Tokenomics with the Dev Protocol team in order to reach a common agreement.&#x20;

### Design

We're still working on a better way to represent the platform fee's distribution flow.&#x20;

Along with that, we have been working on how to represent the Creators Social Tokens that will be captured by the cobogo's treasury.

### Languages

Finally, we are working on implementing Turkish as a new language option for our main website.
