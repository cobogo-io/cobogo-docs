# Week 7 - 11/02/2022

### Discord

We have finally launched our own discord server!&#x20;

[Come join us](https://discord.gg/j7U2zXKk), invite your friends, and YouTubers that you think would benefit from cobogo.&#x20;

We're working on building our community and would love to hear your feedback and inputs in there.

### New Docs Page

We've added another docs page to help YouTube Creators join our wait list and onboard our dapp. Check it out [here](../../overview/getting-started.md).

### New Default Wallet

We've decided to set [Tally](https://tally.cash) as our default wallet for the upcoming dapp. Tally is a wallet run by its users and it's designed to empower communities, so we believe they're in sync with our values.

Check out the new mockups:

### New Investment Round

We have decided to add an extra Investment Round, a Pre-Seed, to help fund cobogo's deployment.&#x20;

This round will be better explained in this upcoming week, but you can read what has been defined so far [here](../../investment-funding/investment-rounds.md).&#x20;

### New proposal for Drips

We have added a new proposal for the integration of Drips Network. You can read it [here](../../platform/protocols/drips-network.md).&#x20;
