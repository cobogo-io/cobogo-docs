# Week 3 - 07/01/2022

In the past few weeks, we have been working on a number of things, regarding the dapp's design and cobogo's tokenomics. We'll present here what has been done. Most of the information presented can be found in this documentation.

### Tokenomics

For the past month, we've been working towards transcribing our vision for the CBG utility token. We have defined the total and circulating supply, determined its distribution among community and private investors, and have characterized the way in which the [Bounties](broken-reference) will happen, and how the [Investment Rounds](broken-reference) will go.

You can check all the information about our Tokenomics [here](../../token/tokenomics.md).&#x20;

### cobogo DAO

We have also been working on a way to explore the Creator Economy's full potential. We've come to the conclusion that giving power to the community is the best way to ensure we're on the right track, so we have defined cobogo as a [DAO](broken-reference).&#x20;

This means that CBG holders will be able to vote and decide for the future of the organization, including, but not limited to, treasury allocations, service provider changes, and tokenomics updates.&#x20;

We believe this to be a major step towards a more democratic platform for all types of Content Creators and Patrons.

### Design

We have so been refining the UI/UX of our dApp, specially channel's profile pages.

With this new update, the withdrawing and staking elements were transformed into buttons that need to be clicked on, in order for a dialog box to open. This ensures a cleaner design with less information in the main page.
