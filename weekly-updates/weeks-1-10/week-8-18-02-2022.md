# Week 8 - 18/02/2022

### New Investment Round

We have defined how the new investment round, the Pre-Seed, will work.&#x20;

The Pre-Seed Round is a way we have found to raise initial funds to help deploying the dApp and creating the YouTube market, while still being an investment for those who wish to be part of this moment in our history.&#x20;

You can read more about it [here](../../investment-funding/community-nft.md).

### New Docs Page&#x20;

We have added another docs page, the [Referral Program](../../youtubers/referral-program.md), with the goal of helping the Creators joining the wait list to refer their friends.&#x20;

The page explains how the bounties will work and how many CBG both the Creator and referred friend will earn.&#x20;

You can check the future rounds for bounties [here](../../tokenomics/bounties.md).

### Development

We continue to work on the onboarding process, specifically, on preparing the dapp for Content Creators to join the waitlist.&#x20;

We hope to have this process ready soon.

For any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out to us on our [Telegram](https://t.me/cobogosocial) group.&#x20;
