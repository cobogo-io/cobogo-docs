# Week 10 - 04/03/2022

### Tokenomics

As mentioned on last week's updates, we will now develop our own business model.

For that, we have redesigned our Tokenomics, including the Supply and Token Distribution. In this new design, our token can be inflationary.&#x20;

The goal is to be able to fund Creators at any given time with our new staking system, where the cobogo token will be the central part.

We will update our Tokenomics section soon.

### Development

We continue to work on our platform's development. We have now included a mobile version.

### Articles

We are currently developing three articles to be posted on [Medium](https://medium.com/@cobogosocial).&#x20;

The first one is going to be about our new scope and the Pre-Seed Investment Round.&#x20;

The second one will cover Social Tokens, how it can revolutionize the way in which people collaborate, and cobogo fits in that revolution.&#x20;

Lastly, the third one is going to be directed towards Patrons, explaining to them how they can support their favorite Creators, use their Social Tokens and be a part of a community.

### Ethereum Rio

As mentioned on last week's updates, our team will participate on Ethereum Rio from March 11th to 20th.&#x20;

For that, we are preparing have our documentation and a pitch deck ready to present to possible investors.
