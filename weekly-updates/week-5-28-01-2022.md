# Week 5 - 28/01/2022

### Unlock Protocol + MintGate

This week, we have applied for an Unlock Protocol [Grant](https://twitter.com/UnlockProtocol/status/1486005958782369798?t=bxSunUv1zdEdzmwa6MekCw\&s=19), where we expressed our ideas for a possible cobogo + Unlock + MintGate integration.&#x20;

We believe these three projects present a perfect fit together, and we would love to see them in action.&#x20;

You can check the details of our proposal [here](../project/protocols/unlock-protocol-+-mintgate.md).

### Website

We have also worked on some adjustments for the cobogo [website](https://cobogo.social), especially regarding the code, and on redesigning some details.

### Infographics

We have worked on two infographics that will help clarify some of our ideas for cobogo.

The fist one is regarding the cobogo DAO and how the Governance token will work, and about what it will be about. You can check it [here](../token/cbg/governance.md).

The second one explains our Tokenomics and how our platform will capture the fee and redistribute it to the community. You can check this one [here](../token/cbg/platform-fee.md).&#x20;

### Scope

Finally, we have delimited cobogo's positioning in the market, that is, as an aggregator of protocols.&#x20;

We have defined some ways in which creators will be able to design incentives for their communities through other protocols.

For any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out to us on our [Telegram](https://t.me/cobogosocial) group.&#x20;
