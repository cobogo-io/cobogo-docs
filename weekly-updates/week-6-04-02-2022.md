# Week 6 - 04/02/2022

### Website

We have launched the [website](https://cobogo.social) with the adjustments remarked last week, including the Turkish version of it, which was translated by a [community member](https://twitter.com/1usdt100usd?t=-YGsJod79pFNW6LoqMd-dg\&s=09).&#x20;

We plan to continue adding other languages, so we can reach as many Creators and their communities as possible.

### New Dev

We have a new team member, [Thiago](https://github.com/thiago0x01), a full stack developer focused on the JavaScript ecosystem and web applications development.&#x20;

Thiago is already working on having the dApp ready for onboarding.

### Partnerships and Grants

We have started contacting key YouTubers we think would benefit from our platform, and that could potentially partner up with cobogo.

In addition, we have applied for a [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/developer-support-program/) grant, since we think the lower fees are fundamental for our market to grow, and because we think we could help expand the Polygon ecosystem.

### New Docs Page

We have added an Overview page, to offer newcomers a quick explanation to what our platform is about.

We plan on adding a "Getting Started" page, to instruct Content Creators that will soon join the waitlist.
