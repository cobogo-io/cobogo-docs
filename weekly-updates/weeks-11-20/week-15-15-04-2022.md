### Waitlist

Our waitlist is up! YouTube Content Creators can now submit their channel and start letting their communities know about how they will be able to support them in the future.

Creators can earn CBG tokens when joining the wait list, and they can also refer their friends to join, to earn more CBG.

To submit your channel to the wait list, click [here](https://app.cobogo.social).

To learn more about the referral program, click [here](../../creators/referral-program.md).

### New Pages

We have reorganized the flow of this documentation, and included some pages that clarify more what cobogo is, including a page about the funding mechanism, and a page about how will the NFT as proof of active patronage work.

Check our new [Funding Mechanism](broken-reference) page and [NFT as Proof of Patronage](broken-reference) page, and our [Branding](../../branding/logo-concept.md) pages.

### Medium

We have worked on a new medium article, explaining to people beginning in crypto what Staking is, why is it a good idea, and how it can benefit Creators in the Creator Economy.

This article will be posted soon.
