# Week 14 - 08/04/2022

### Medium

We have posted a new article on Medium, made especially for Patrons and people not familiar with blockchain and Web3.&#x20;

The article explain in simple finance terms what is to stake tokens to someone, and how this can be used to support Content Creators

You can check it out [here](https://medium.com/@cobogosocial/how-to-use-blockchain-to-support-your-favorite-content-creators-9ae2b04a0c38).

### Community

As mentioned last week, we are working on building a community of Content Creators, that already has 20 members. Some of these members are helping us write a script to help guide the video that YouTubers will have to upload to complete the onboarding process.

We believe this is a great way to start preparing our Creators for our future DAO of Creators.

In addition, we are planning on holding weekly Community Calls to straighten the relationship with this Creators and our community.

### Development

Google has finally approved our dApp, which makes us even closer to launching our waitlist.

### Grants

We have been applying for several grants and talking to a lot of investors in order to proceed with the development of the platform.
