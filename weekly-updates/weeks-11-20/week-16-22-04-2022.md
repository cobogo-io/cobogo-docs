### Waitlist

We have announced on all Social Media about our waitlist being up. YouTube Content Creators can now submit their channel and start letting their communities know about how they will be able to support them in the future.

We are now working on an article talking about how quantity, that is, the number of likes someone gets on Social Media, is a metric of the past, and Content Creators should focus on acquiring real, true fans. This article will be posted soon.

### Prototype

We've created a prototype of what our platform will look like once it's launched. You can click on some buttons and have fun with it!

We believe this is a great way to show investors and our community how our platform will soon look like.
