We are now working on an article talking about how quantity, that is, the number of likes someone gets on Social Media, is a metric of the past, and Content Creators should focus on acquiring real, true fans. This article will be posted soon.

### Prototype

We've created a prototype of what our platform will look like once it's launched. You can click on some buttons and have fun with it!

We believe this is a great way to show investors and our community how our platform will soon look like.
