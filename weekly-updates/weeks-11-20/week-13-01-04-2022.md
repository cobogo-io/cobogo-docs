# Week 13 - 01/04/2022

### Onboarding

The onboarding process is almost ready! We're just waiting for Google's approval so we can get it live.

### Medium

We have posted a new article on Medium regarding Social Tokens, called "Empower your community through Social Tokens".&#x20;

This article goes through what Social Tokens are, how they can help a Creator build their community, why they haven't gone mainstream, and how to mint your own.

You can check it [here](https://medium.com/@cobogosocial/empower-your-community-through-social-tokens-504484800836).&#x20;

### Community

As mentioned last week, we've been working on building our community, especially our community of Content Creators. Our Content Creator's group has now 21 Brazilian members, and we consider this to be a great step to build our DAO.&#x20;

If you wish to join this group, send us a message!

### Grants

We have been applying for several grants and in contact with many investors to kick off our Seed Round.
