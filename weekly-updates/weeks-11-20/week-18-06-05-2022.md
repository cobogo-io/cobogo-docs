# Week 18 - 06/05/2022

### Medium

We continue on our mission to post quick and simple articles tailored for beginners in crypto. This week we have posted an article talking about DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations), describing what they are and how they can benefit Creators.

Give it a look [here](https://medium.com/@cobogosocial/communities-strike-back-a-time-for-content-creators-daos-590a036e0497).&#x20;

We have finished another article about NFTs, which will be posted early next week.

### Development

We have been working hard on development, and are close to finish the Referral Program.&#x20;

In addition, the dapp's development is really advanced, which makes us one step closer to the MVP.

### Design

We have been working together with a Design Studio to create an animation that explains in a fun way how our split funding mechanism works. We believe this is a great way to clarify our mechanism to beginners, and possibly to YouTubers outside the crypto sphere, and grow our platform even more.

&#x20;With that, we have also been working on a new version of our main website [cobogo.social](https://cobogo.social) to match this animation.
