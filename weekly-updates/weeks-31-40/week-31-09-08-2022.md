### Design

Regarding cobogo's design, we have been working on the mobile version for the Creator Profiles, and for new features that we plan to integrate in the future.

### Business

This we have worked hard on cobogo's business aspect. We have registered cobogo into a platform that matches startups with VCs, we have had meetings with Creators to talk about the Creator Profiles, and we have had meetings we potential partners for the platform.

We have been very diligent when it comes to getting funding, and we've been in contact with various VCs.
