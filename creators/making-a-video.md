# Making a Video

There are currently a few ways to earn CBG tokens.

If you want to earn 1,000 CBG tokens, you can do so by recording and posting a video talking about cobogo to your YouTube channel after finishing the [whitelisting](getting-started.md) process.

The video doesn't have to be too long, it only needs to be longer than 2 minutes, so you can explain what cobogo is, and how your community will be able to support you in the future. You can go to [this page](<../README (1).md>) to learn more about cobogo.

You will also need to include the name "cobogo" in the video, so we can find your video more easily and reward you.

Lastly, you'll have to link your Referral Program page in the video description box, so your community can find you on cobogo
