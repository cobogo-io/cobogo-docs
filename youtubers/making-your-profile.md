# Making your Profile

As stated in [this](../overview/how-it-works/creator-profiles.md) page, Cobogo will facilitate the work of Creators by having **all the needed information for a Media Kit in just one place**, where they can **showcase their services to high-quality clients**, in standardized **Creator Profiles**.

In this section, we will go through how to make your Profile look more **like you**, so you can attract more **potential clients**.

### Basic Information

After **connecting your channel** and onboarding cobogo, you can update the Basic Information on your profile.&#x20;

1. You can **write a description** with a minimum of 140 characters about you, your channel, or the content you usually make. We recommend being **creative**! Let people know what you are **passionate** about!
2. Then, you can link a video that you think **introduces you** the best. You don't have to record something new just for this, you can link a video that is **already up** in your channel.
3. After this, choose the **handle** for your Creator Profile. It can be the same as your YouTube channel or something new.
4. Choose the **general category** of your channel or the content you produce.
5. Then, you can expand on some **other categories** that fit you, with up to 5 tags.
6. In "website url" you can link your **preferred website** (LinkedIn, YouTube, GitHub, it's up to you!)
7. In avatar, you can choose your **Profile Picture.**
8. For the profile's banner, **1280x308** is the ideal size.
