To start using cobogo as a Creator, you will have to go through the following onboarding process:

### Submitting a Channel

First, you will have to click on "join now" on the main page. Then, you'll have to submit your channel for analysis by connecting to your YouTube account. Your credentials and passwords will not be stored for future network authentications.

Eventually, we want to support Creators from other platforms, but initially, the whitelist will be intended for YouTube Content Creators.

### Creating a Profile

After that, you will have to create your profile. In this profile, you will write a description about your channel, which will be visible to the public, defining the type of content you usually create, and any other information you think should be there.

In addition, you will have to choose a handle for your profile, and the categories your channel is inserted in, so that your profile is more easily found when fans are looking for a channel to support.

After that, hit 'send to review'. Don't worry, you'll be able to change these options later if you want to.

### Inviting your friends

You have now guaranteed your 100 CBG tokens and your exclusive Content Creator NFT!

There's a few more tasks you can do in order to earn more, and each of them are described in the list.

We give special attention to Referral Program part, where you can earn 50 more CBG for each YouTuber that joins the whitelist using your referral link. The more friends complete the onboarding process, more CBG you and them can earn!

You can learn more about the Referral Program [here](referral-program.md).&#x20;
