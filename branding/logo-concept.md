# Logo Concept

> "Cobog√≥ is an element of Brazilian architecture. It is a little block of concrete that allows light and fresh air to come inside rooms, they can have infinite different styles and colors which can always be combined to form new unique style."

All these characteristics can be associated with what we want to achieve with this dApp. The blocks allude to both **blockchain** and **composability** (which are usually compared to Lego blocks), the light entering the room represents the videos being watched in the house of each fan and the air represents the new ways that the ecosystem allows creators to monetize themselves, allowing new types of Creators to rise and be successful.
