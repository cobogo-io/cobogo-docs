# Rounds

There will be a total of three investment rounds for cobogo. The Seed round, the Private Sales and the Public Sales. In each round, different amounts of CBG tokens will be sold, at different prices.

### First Round - Seed Round

In the first round, called Seed, the amount of 10,000,000, equivalent to 10% of the total supply, will be offered to a maximum of five external investors, at the price of $0.08. This will happen in March, 2022, and at this point, Content Creators will start onboarding the platform and minting their pools. These tokens will not be locked, but they will have a vesting period of 12 months, which means that by the end of the Seed round, the cobogo token will have a market cap of $800,000 and a circulation supply of 10,000,000.

### Second Round - Private Sale

The second investment round will be destined to Private Sales, and 10,000,000 more CBG tokens will be sold. Scheduled to happen in June, 2022, the token will be sold at $0.24, elevating the circulation supply to 20,000,000 and the market cap to $4,800,000 at the end of the vesting period. At this juncture, we expect about 60,000 Content Creators to have their pools minted in cobogo and to be actively asking their communities to stake for them.

### Third Round - Public Sale

The last investment round will happen in January, 2023, and it is when 16,000,000 CBG tokens will be open to be acquired and traded by the general public, at the price of $0.60. By then, there will be 36,000,000 circulating CBG, and by the time the vesting period ends, there will be a market cap of $17,280,000. If the expected growth continues, there will be 180,000 Content Creators using the platform by the time the third investment round starts.

We predict that each of these rounds will bring out a more consolidated platform, and by the end of all three of them, we hope cobogo to be known across not only crypto communities, but in all Content Creators spheres and spaces.
