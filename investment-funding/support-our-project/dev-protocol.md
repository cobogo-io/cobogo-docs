# Dev Protocol

> "Dev Protocol is on-chain middleware created for a whole new ecosystem designed for Open Source Software (OSS). With Dev Protocol, anyone can start to monetize their creations without changing licenses, codes, and support."

When you buy DEV tokens, you can choose a project to stake on and receive a yield in the form of inflationary rewards, using the dApp [stakes.social](https://stakes.social).&#x20;

This means that every year, 3.15% new DEVs are minted and allocated to Creators and Stakers, in a 51:49 split.

In other words, both you and cobogo get interest, allowing you to sustainably fund us.
