# Scalable Equity Financing

Even though Creators are building real media empires, they still rely on their own cash flow or debt financing to grow. That means they usually have to create content that is not in line with what they want, chase trends and spend their time doing marketing campaigns since they can't properly monetize with ads without having millions of followers. It also means that, with debt financing, Creators have less incentive to take a risk to do what they really love.

Equity financing changes all that.&#x20;
