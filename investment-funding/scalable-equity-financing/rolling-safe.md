# Rolling SAFE

Rolling SAFE is a legal template that lets founders raise money continuously, across the whole life of their company up until an IPO. The Rolling SAFE allows investors to invest in a company at any time, with the valuation increasing automatically as more funds are raised, benefitting investors who move quickly.
