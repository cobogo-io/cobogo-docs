We are an ecosystem made especially for **Creators**, with the goal of introducing scalable equity financing for Creators with their own businesses, kickstarting a new era for the Creator Economy.

We are building a Creator Investment Ecosystem, which is a set of products that help Creators in their journey from starting a business to becoming successful.

We do that by offering Creators the latest cutting-edge technology tools to raise funds through their own audience and monetize their creations or whatever else they want. It works as follows:

1. **Cobogo Social** is an evolution of a media kit, intelligent and automated with all the Creators' social media. Its objective is to aggregate all their data and relevant indicators and make it transparent and verifiable;
2. **Cobogo Growth** is a membership for Creators to access exclusive communities focused on educating Creators on how to incorporate and run a business, raising capital, and everything they need to become a real business;
3. **Cobogo Fundraising Tools** is an ecosystem of tools that allows Creators to incorporate their companies and launch their security offering, leveraging scalable equity financing solutions to execute their ideas and projects;
4. **Cobogo DAO** is an investment DAo built together with OrigamiDAO, using the Origami Framework. Focused in investing in early/seed stage Creators from all over the world, with the biggest growth potential.

Investors receive equity representing a right to future equity in the Creator's company.

This all means that Cobogo allows Creators to become a business, raise capital for it, and allocate equity to those who invested in them, letting key stakeholders participate in their company's success.&#x20;

Anyone, from VCs to Creators' own audiences can fund them at any time, with no need for pitches or tiresome negotiations.
