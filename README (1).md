# What is cobogo?

## Creator Investment Ecosystem

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/fly.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Flywheel describing our ecosystem.</p></figcaption></figure>

We are an ecosystem made especially for **Creators**, with the goal of introducing scalable equity financing for Creators with their own businesses, kickstarting a new era for the Creator Economy.

We are building a Creator Investment Ecosystem, which is a set of products that help Creators in their journey from starting a business to becoming successful.

We do that by offering Creators the latest cutting-edge technology tools to raise funds through their own audience and monetize their creations or whatever else they want. It works as follows:

1. **Cobogo Social** is an evolution of a media kit, intelligent and automated with all the Creators' social media. Its objective is to aggregate all their data and relevant indicators and make it transparent and verifiable;
2. **Cobogo Basecamp** is an **** education and acceleration program for Creators who want to become professionals. It's focused on mastering how to incorporate and run a business, raising capital and use cutting edge tools to launch their own public offering. In addition to participating in a community with other Creators who are going through the same process.
3. **Cobogo DAO** is an investment DAO built together with OrigamiDAO, using the Origami Framework. Focused in investing in early/seed stage Creators from all over the world, with the biggest growth potential.

Investors receive equity representing a right to future equity in the Creator's company.

This all means that Cobogo allows Creators to become a business, raise capital for it, and allocate equity to those who invested in them, letting key stakeholders participate in their company's success.&#x20;

Anyone, from VCs to Creators' own audiences can fund them at any time, with no need for pitches or tiresome negotiations.
