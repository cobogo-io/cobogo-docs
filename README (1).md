## Creator Investment Ecosystem

We are a platform made especially for **Content Creators**, with the goal of introducing scalable equity financing for Creators with their own businesses, kickstarting a new era for the Creator Economy.

We are building a Creator Investment Ecosystem, which is a set of products that help Creators in their journey from starting a business to becoming successful

We do that by offering Creators Web3's latest cutting-edge technology tools to raise funds through their own audience and monetize their creations or whatever else they want. It works as follows:

1. **Cobogo Social** is an evolution of a media kit, intelligent and automated with all the Creators' social media. Its objective is to aggregate all their data and relevant indicators and make it transparent and verifiable;
2. **Cobogo Growth** is a membership for Creators to access exclusive communities focused on educating Creators on how to incorporate and run a business, raising capital, and everything they need to become a real business;
3. **Cobogo Tools** transforms the Creator's business into a Continuous Organization, that allows them to tokenize equity of their company;
4. Using **Rolling SAFE**, investors can receive equity security that represents a right to future equity in the Creator's company
5. Creators get access to **Continuous Fundraising.**

In addition, **Cobogo Ventures** is a seed/early-stage that will fund prominent Creator based on a proprietary algorithm that estimates Creators' valuation.

This all means that Cobogo allows Creators to become a business, raise capital for it, and allocate equity to those who invested in them, letting key stakeholders participate in their company's success.&#x20;

Anyone from VCs to Creators' own audiences can fund them at any time, with no need for pitches or tiresome negotiations.
