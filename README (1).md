# What is cobogo?

## Business Infrastructure for Creators

We are a platform made especially for **Content Creators**, with the goal of making Creators their own businesses.

We are building a Business Infrastructure for Creators, which is a set of products that help Creators in their journey from starting a business to becoming successful

We do that by offering Creators Web3's latest cutting-edge technology tools to raise funds through their own audience and monetize their creations or whatever else they want. It works as follows:

1. Cobogo Start helps Creators launch and run a US business (from anywhere in the world);
2. Cobogo Fundraise transforms the Creator's business into a Continuous Organization, that allows them to tokenize equity of their company;
3. With Cobogo Social, Creators can present their business to investors, brands, and their own audience;
4. Using Rolling SAFE, investors can receive equity security that represents a right to future equity in the Creator's company
5. Creators get access to Continuous Fundraising

In addition, Cobogo Ventures is a seed/early-stage that will fund prominent Creator based on a proprietary algorithm that estimates Creators' valuation.

This all means that Cobogo allows Creators to become a business, raise capital for it, and allocate equity to those who invested in them, letting key stakeholders participate in their company's success.&#x20;

Anyone from VCs to Creators' own audiences can fund them at any time, with no need for pitches or tiresome negotiations.
