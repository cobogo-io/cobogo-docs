# What is cobogo?

## Business Infrastructure for Creators

We are a platform made especially for **Content Creators**, and we have the goal of making Creators their own businesses.

We are building a Business Infrastructure for Creators, which is a set of products that help Creators in their journey from starting a business to becoming successful

We do that by offering Creators Web3's latest cutting edge technology tools to raise funds through their own audience and monetize their creations or whatever else they want. It works as follows:

1. Cobogo Start helps Creators launch and run a US business (from anywhere in the world);
2. Cobogo Fundraise transforms the Creator's business into a Continuous Organization, that allows them tokenize equity of their company;
3. With Cobogo Social, Creators can present their business to investors, brands, and their own audience;
4. Using Rolling SAFE, investors can receive an equity security that represents a right to future equity in the Creator's company
5. Creators get access to Continuous Fundraising

This all means that Cobogo allows Creators to become a business, raise capital for it, and allocate equity to those who invested in them, letting key stakeholders participate in their company's success.&#x20;

Anyone from VCs to Creators' own audience can fund them at any time, with no need for pitches or tiresome negotiations.
