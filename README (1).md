# What is cobogo?

cobogo is a platform made especially for **Content Creators**, that has the goal of giving them **power** their own monetization and their communities, using Web3 to achieve that.

In the cobogo platform, Creators can:

1. advertise their **Media Kit**, showing their work, metrics, options for collaboration, and any other information they want **high-quality clients** to see; and&#x20;
2. be **sustainably funded** through their own communities by using our unique **Staking Mechanism**.

We want Content Creators to be able to **easily and quickly** showcase what they do to potential clients, and **match them** with this clients in what we call the **Media Market**. This way, we want to help Creators sell their services and at the same time, we want to help clients find the Creators in our platform that **best fit** their needs.&#x20;

Not only that, but we believe in the power people can have when they **come together**, and for that, we want Creators to explore the **full potential** their community can have.&#x20;

This is possible due to our **Staking Mechanism**, that works by allowing Creators to mint their own Social Token and Staking Pool, where their fans can stake on it. After that, both Creators and Fans **get rewards** in the form of a yield, in a 50%/50% split.

All Creators have to do after minting their pool is let their community know about this opportunity, and how it is a **win-win situation**. They can also offer Perks to those staking from them, which can vary from receiving the Creatorâ€™s Social Tokens, getting access to a private discord, private content and even being able to vote for the next videos' type of content. The possibilities are endless.

After that, we will transform cobogo into the first **Content Creator DAO**, where everything will be automated, and both Fans and Creators will **jointly decide** on what steps to take, through a governance vote.

We intend to **keep growing**, introducing more monetization methods and finding new ways to give rewards and benefits for Creators and Patrons.&#x20;
