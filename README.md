# What is cobogo?

cobogo is an aggregator of protocols that has the goal of funding Content Creators sustainably through their own community. It is a dApp that leverages Web 3.0 to monetize Creators while maximizing their growth and community building abilities.

It works by allowing Creators to mint their own Social Tokens and Staking Pool, where Patrons can stake on it. After that, both Creators and Patrons get rewards in the form of a yield, in a 50%/50% split.

All Creators have to do after minting their pool is let their community know about this opportunity, and how it is a win-win situation. They can also offer Perks to those staking from them, which can vary from receiving the Creatorâ€™s Social Tokens, getting access to a private discord, private content and even being able to vote for the next videos' type of content. The possibilities are endless.

We intend to keep growing, introducing more monetization methods and finding new ways to give rewards and benefits for Creators and Patrons.&#x20;
