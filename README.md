## The Creator Economy

We know how difficult it is for Creators of all kinds to make a living out of their creations. Although Web 2.0 has allowed an easily accessible monetization for the masses, some people still struggle with this combination of "decentralized delivery and centralized control".

With Web 3.0, Creators can take their work to a next level, truly owning it. The integration with cryptoeconomy grants them the possibility of building an economy around them, maximizing their value.

In the particular case we are addressing with cobogo, Creators can finally become **founders of their own businesses**, assembling tools to help them raise funds and to do what they love.
