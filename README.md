# Introduction

## The Creator Economy

We know how difficult it is for Creators of all kinds to make a living out of their creations. Although Web 2.0 has allowed an easily accessible monetization for the masses, some people still struggle with this combination of "decentralized delivery and centralized control".&#x20;

With Web 3.0, Creators can take their work to a next level, truly owning it. The integration with cryptoeconomy grants them the possibility of building an economy around their projects and community, maximizing their value.

In the particular case we are addressing with Cobogo Social, YouTube Creators can finally have the freedom to produce any content they want, without having to rely on a centralized control institution overwatching them, only in their own community.

## Dev Protocol

[Dev Protocol](https://docs.devprotocol.xyz/en/introduction/) is a Japanese project that allows Creators to monetize their work in a sustainable way.&#x20;

They do this currently in their [stakes.social](https://stakes.social) dApp, where Open Source Software (OSS) Creators can apply their projects through the onboarding process, get their project authenticated, have their Social Tokens minted, and finally have their Staking Pool deployed, where Patrons can stake DEV Tokens on.

By staking, both Creators and Patrons receive a yield in the form of inflationary rewards. Stakers can also hold governance rights over Dev Protocol, and for that, can have a voice in deciding tokenomics or proposing new ideas.&#x20;

This is all possible due to the token being inflationary, which means that every year 3.15% new DEV tokens are minted and allocated to Creators and Stakers, in a 51:49 split.

## Cobogo Social

[Cobogo](https://cobogo.social) uses Dev Protocol to monetize YouTube Creators, through Social Tokens, that are based on Decentralized Finance (DeFi) mechanisms.&#x20;

It works similarly to Dev Protocol's system for OSS Creators:

1. Creators submit their channel to be reviewed;
2. Once approved, the Creators can mint their own Tokens and Staking Pool;
3. With the Staking Pool in place, Patrons can stake DEV Tokens on it;
4. Both Creator and Patron start getting the rewards accrued.

In addition, Cobogo makes it possible for small and niche YouTube Creators to monetize their work by their own community, without having to wait for the 1,000 subscribers count, or being "ad friendly".&#x20;

Creators will also be able to offer special perks to those Patrons who stake on them, such as the Creator's Social Tokens, access to a private discord, special content and many more.

#### We believe Cobogo can be more than a market for YouTubers, but instead, that Youtube can be a tool for all kinds of Creators looking to connect themselves and their communities to this method of monetization.
