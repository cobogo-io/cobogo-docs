{% hint style="info" %}
cobogo's mission is to give Creators **ownership**, allowing them to grant **equity** to their audience in exchange for investment in their personal business.

In this page we briefly explain the problem that motivated the creation of this project, and in this documentation we will go through how we solve it.

## The Creator Economy

We know how difficult it is for Creators of all kinds to make a living out of their creations. Although Web 2.0 has allowed an easily accessible monetization for the masses, some people still struggle.&#x20;

On the other side, startups are able to raise millions of dollars in a few weeks while Creators often struggle for years to make ends meet. The Startup ecosystem has evolved in terms of financing models, but Creators' ecosystem hasn't developed the same way.

Until now, Creators were treated as mere freelancers, but some of them are disrupting the entire media world by transforming their audience into a scalable buyer empire. Most of them still don't have the tools to catch up with this market opportunity.

In the particular case we are addressing with cobogo, Creators can finally become **founders of their own businesses**, assembling tools to help them raise funds and to do what they love.
