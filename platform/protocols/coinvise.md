## Coinvise and cobogo integration proposal

As written in Coinvise's own [docs](https://coinvise.notion.site/About-5fb7ccf93bbe4257bde71a5be73537be) :

> Coinvise is an open platform on Ethereum where creators can launch a social & build a tokenized community.

With Coinvise, Creators and Communities can mint social tokens, airdrops them,  create rewards and bounties. We see all of the airdrop, rewards and bounties mechanisms useful not only for cobogo but for all the Content Creators that mint their social tokens through cobogo. This way, we want to set the precedent and be involved with other important Creator Economy and Social Tokens platforms.

#### Integration Proposal

We have envisioned a Quest system that will be the center of the dapp, with all other funding mechanisms and integrations revolving around it. We see it not only as a way to increase the demand for social tokens but will also to collect fees and make our tokenomics sustainable.

As it is really important for our goals, we are still deliberating on the best way to create an architecture for quests in a way to create a unique market for contents. Here is how we have designed it so far:

**The goal of cobogo's Quest System is to create a market that will match Content Creators with Individuals, Communities and Companies that want to promote themselves.**

A **** Quest consists of proposals that describe a certain Content that a Business, Communities or Individuals want to see created. They could offer a fixed value or could be a crowdfunding type of contract, where they would add as many funds as they want, and vote proportionally to approve the quest if a creator creates a content for them.

Creators could make counter-offers and compete between themselves to offer the best content at the best prices for cobogo users. These Creators are incredibly hard to reach, so by creating this market aggregator where they could compete for quests to create content could be valuable and benefit both parties, a win-win type of solution.

This is the first system that we plan to implement on cobogo. Our vision is to use the reward splitting funding mechanism not as an end on itself but as a way to attract as many content creators as possible.&#x20;

We see that Coinvise already has a successful Quest system, we believe that our market would a be a perfect fit for it. We open for suggestions to make it work in the way we are designing it.
