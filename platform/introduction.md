# Introduction

## The Creator Economy

We know how difficult it is for Creators of all kinds to make a living out of their creations. Although Web 2.0 has allowed an easily accessible monetization for the masses, some people still struggle with this combination of "decentralized delivery and centralized control".&#x20;

With Web 3.0, Creators can take their work to a next level, truly owning it. The integration with cryptoeconomy grants them the possibility of building an economy around their projects and community, maximizing their value.

In the particular case we are addressing with Cobogo Social, Content Creators can finally have the freedom to produce any content they want, without having to rely on a centralized control institution overwatching them, only in their own community.

### Concept

> "Cobogó is an element of Brazilian architecture. It is a little block of concrete that allows light and fresh air to come inside rooms, they can have infinite different styles and colors which can always be combined to form new unique style."

All these characteristics can be associated with what we want to achieve with this dApp. The blocks allude to both **blockchain** and **composability** (which are usually compared to Lego blocks), the light entering the room represents the videos being watched in the house of each fan and the air represents the new ways that the ecosystem allows creators to monetize themselves, allowing new types of Creators to rise and be successful.

### How it works?

[cobogo](https://cobogo.social) is an aggregator of protocols that aims at helping Content Creators monetize their work, through Social Tokens, that are based on Decentralized Finance (DeFi) mechanisms.&#x20;

It works as follows:

1. Creators submit their channel to be reviewed;
2. Once approved, the Creators can mint their own Tokens and Staking Pool;
3. With the Staking Pool in place, Patrons can stake on it;
4. Both Creator and Patron start getting the rewards accrued.

Creators will also be able to offer special perks to those Patrons who stake on them, such as the Creator's Social Tokens, access to a private discord, special content and many more.

In addition, cobogo makes it possible for small and niche YouTube Creators to monetize their work by their own community, without having to wait for the 1,000 subscribers count, or being "ad friendly".&#x20;

#### We believe cobogo can be more than a market for YouTubers, but instead, that Youtube can be a tool for all kinds of Creators looking to connect themselves and their communities through this method of monetization.
