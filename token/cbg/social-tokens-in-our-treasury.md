# Social Tokens

cobogo captures value from all the Content Creators onboarded into its system by using Dev Protocol's Social Token minting mechanism.\
\
Every Content Creator that onboards cobogo gets 10 Million Social Tokens minted at the time the Khaos Oracle authenticates the project's ownership and a staking pool is deployed. 5% (500.000) of each of these tokens go to cobogo's treasury.

This way, every time a Content Creator builds an economy and uses the power of his minted Social Tokens to grow, cobogo captures a share of it. Potentially cobogo's treasury can be seen as a Content Creator ETF, capturing value from all the active Social Tokens.\
\
Since CBG is the governance token of the DAO, it also directly captures this value since the DAO can vote what to do with all the Social Tokens in its Treasury.
