**Name:** CBG Token

**Ticker:** CBG

**Initial Supply:** 100,000,000

CBG is the fungible token (ERC-20) of the Cobogo ecosystem. The token total initial supply will be fully allocated in a Pre-Seed Round and Seed Round, in Private and Public Sales, Founders, Treasury, Strategic YouTubers, Airdrops and Bounties.

The Cobogo Token is an utility token that allows Creators to be monetized directly by their Super Fans through a split yield monetization mechanism.&#x20;

It is also a Governance Token that gives its holders the right to vote on DAO decisions. For that, CBG is a key incentive and a necessary token for Fans that want to support Creators through the platform while still accruing yield.

At genesis, CBG will have an initial total supply, and tokens will be emitted following an emission model where the staking ratio of the circulating supply is inversely proportional to the token emission.&#x20;

Moreover, cobogo has designed a burning mechanism for the first three years, so that the total supply equals the genesis total supply for that time.&#x20;

The idea is to give early investors a clear vision over the total supply, so it doesnâ€™t change during their vesting period. The emission will also be controlled as emission bands have been put in place in the model, which is expected to tend to a lower emission over time.
