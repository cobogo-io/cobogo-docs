# Platform Fee

There wonâ€™t be any fees for Creators or Fans to use the cobogo monetization mechanism.&#x20;

Fans will be able to deposit and withdraw CBG tokens at any time they want. Creators will be free to onboard cobogo and withdraw their rewards without any additional fees from cobogo (gas fees are still applicable).

### New Features

In order to capture a share of the growth of the ecosystem to the DAO Treasury, sustain its development and future ventures, cobogo will introduce fees to features that it introduces to the ecosystem.&#x20;

A few of these features are already planned and a flat 5% fee will be introduced for each of those features.

#### Media Market

On the media market, third parties will pay a 5% fee for all the media that they hire with cobogo as an agency. The fees will go to the DAO Treasury.&#x20;

In the media market, there will be introduced agents, which are individuals that approach companies and redirect them to hire Creators via cobogo (and vice-versa), these individuals will be able to collect a fee of up to 10% of the total negotiated.
