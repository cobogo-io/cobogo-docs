# Split Yield Monetization

As described in the "[How it works](../../overview/how-it-works/funding-mechanism.md)?" section, Cobogo has designed a win-win monetization mechanism that allows fans to support Creators sustainably.

The staking mechanism generates a positive feedback loop environment, where both Creators and Fans get rewarded and can interact. It works as follows:&#x20;

Creators join cobogo by completing the whitelisting process, where a Creator Profile is automatically generated and a Staking Pool Smart Contract is deployed (by the Creator). With that, Creators can invite their Fans to stake CBG tokens on their staking pool.&#x20;

When Fans deposit CBG on a Creator staking pool, they receive the CFT, a composable NFT as a receipt that represents that staking position; and both the Fan and the Creator start accruing yield in CBG which are equally split (50-50).&#x20;

These tokens will not have a vesting period, so both Fans and Creators will be able to withdraw the principal in CBG and the accrued yield at any time.
