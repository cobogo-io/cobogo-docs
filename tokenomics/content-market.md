# Content Market

Cobogo has designed the idea for an open Content Market that will slowly become the main use of the dapp, with all other funding mechanisms and integrations revolving around it. This will be a way to increase the demand for the CBG token. It will allow cobogo to collect more fees and make the tokenomics more sustainable.&#x20;

The best way to build an architecture for quests in a way to create a unique market for contents is still in deliberation. However, here is how we have designed it so far:&#x20;

The goal of cobogo's Content Market is to create a market that will match, on-chain, Content Creators with Individuals, Communities and Companies that want to promote themselves. This is possible through quests, which anyone on the platform can make.&#x20;

A quest consists of proposals that describe a certain Content that a Business, Communities or Individuals want to see created. They could offer a fixed value or could be a crowdfunding type of contract, where they would add as many funds as they want, and vote proportionally to approve the quest if a creator makes the content for them.&#x20;

Creators could make counter-offers and compete between themselves to offer the best content at the best prices for cobogo users. These Creators can be incredibly hard to reach, and requesters hard to trust.&#x20;

So by creating this market aggregator where they could compete for quests to create content could be valuable and benefit both parties, a win-win type of solution.&#x20;

A quest could be closed even if no Creator has accepted it or submitted a solution. Resolvers would be added to solve a dispute, at first this could be done by the cobogo team, but as it progresses, the DAO could vote and choose resolvers. New quests shouldnâ€™t be able to be submitted, if there is a dispute in place.
