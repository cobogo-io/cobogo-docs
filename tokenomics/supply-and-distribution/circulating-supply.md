# Circulating Supply

The circulating supply is the total amount of tokens in circulation at a certain given time.&#x20;

Following that definition, it will start at zero, and progressively increase as the vesting period ends for each specific investing round, as described in the next sections.&#x20;

All the token allocations will enter the market asynchronously over 48 months, and some of them will be locked in for a year before doing so. As the smart contracts from the split reward monetization mechanism get deployed, the token emission will also enter circulation, naturally, it will be part of the circulating supply.&#x20;

This way, the circulation supply will be composed of vested tokens being released over time, the tokens on the public sale, and the token rewards.
