# Rewards

As described on the [Token Emission](../token-emission.md) Section, Rewards are the actual monetary incentives ruled by cobogo’s emission model in which all of the CBG token emission will exclusively, by smart contract, be distributed pro rata to the size of the staking positions in relation to the sum of all of the current staking positions.

The reward emission is equal to the token emission - represented by equation (2), which is inversely proportional to the staking ratio, that is, the lower the amount of CBG staked in relation to the total CBG circulating supply, the higher the Reward is, and vice-versa (this relationship is described on equation ( 3 )). This way, cobogo creates incentives for first-mover Fans to fund their favorite creators and be rewarded for it.

CBG token emission is ruled by the following model:

By minimally increasing the total supply, and distributing it to stakers (part of the circulating supply), cobogo is able to create a significant APY to reward first-movers. The goal is to use this mechanism to attract as many Creators as possible, and to generate network effects, at the same time that we implement easy to offer perks and services from which the DAO will collect fees.&#x20;

As the number of active Creators grows and valuable Perks are implemented, it is expected that the Yield coming exclusively from emissions will continue to go down. We also expect the platform to be viewed as less risky, and the Perks so valuable that individuals are willing to stake instead of donating just to be able to access those Perks, and interact with the Creator, regardless of the Yield .&#x20;

Given the scenario of low yield coming from emission, it is recommended that, in the future, the fees collected on the platform are distributed to stakers, on top of the yield coming from emission. This way, it is recommended that the future formula for the Reward follows along these lines:

Where 𝐹 is the amount of fees collected on the platform at a certain time. Substituting 𝑡 𝑆 with to represent the rewards coming from emission alone, we can represent 𝑡 − 𝑆𝑡−1 𝐸𝑡 the Reward formula as:

This way, it is easier to see that, as an example where Yield from emissions tends to lower single digits as cobogo is adopted (higher staking ratio), this adoption should reflect in increased fee collection. It might get to a point where yield coming from fees surpass the yield coming from token emission, this should be the goal to become a sustainable ecosystem.
