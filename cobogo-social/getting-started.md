To make your Profile, you will have to go through this following onboarding process:

### Submitting a Channel

First, you will have to click on "_join now_" on the main page.&#x20;

Then, you'll have to submit your channel by connecting to your YouTube account. Your credentials and passwords will not be stored for future network authentications.

### Creating a Profile

After that, you will have to create your profile. In this profile, you will write a description about your channel, which will be visible to the public, defining the type of content you usually create, and any other information you think should be there.

In addition, you will have to choose a handle for your profile, and the categories your channel is inserted in, so that your profile is more easily found when fans are looking for a channel to support.

After that, hit 'next step'. Don't worry, you'll be able to change these options later, and add more information regarding your services and metrics.
