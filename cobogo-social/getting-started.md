# Getting Started

{% hint style="info" %}
#### To have your own Creator Profile, go to [https://cobogo.social](https://app.cobogo.social)
{% endhint %}

With cobogo, you can have your own personalized Creator Profile that shows all the relevant information about you and your services. Read more about the Creator Profiles [here](../overview/how-it-works/creator-profiles.md).

To make your Profile, you will have to go through this following onboarding process:

### Submitting a Channel

First, you will have to click on "_Create your profile_" on the main page.&#x20;

Then, you'll have to submit your channel by connecting to your Social Media account. Your **credentials and passwords will not be stored** for future network authentications. Only your **public data** will be shared with Cobogo, this way we can verify your channel and through the Social Media API we will be able to always display your latest numbers on every connection.

### Creating a Profile

After that, you will have to create your profile. In this profile, you will write a description about your channel, which will be visible to the public, defining the type of content you usually create, and any other information you think should be there.

In addition, you will have to choose a handle for your profile, and the categories your channel is inserted in, so that your profile is more easily found when fans are looking for a channel to support.

After that, hit 'next step'. Don't worry, you'll be able to change these options later, and add more information regarding your services and metrics.
