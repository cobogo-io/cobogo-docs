{% hint style="info" %}
If you're a **YouTuber**, go to [this](../youtubers/referral-program.md) tutorial.
{% endhint %}

If you are a Fan you came across this page below from a YouTuber's link, you can connect your MetaMask Wallet to get your own referral link to earn 50 CBG tokens for every YouTuber that joins.
